# Drink N' Buy
This little app was made for a hackathon in Madrid, Spain in less than 9 hours. The theme was culture and the requirement was to use the Snap Payment API.
The Snap API is disabled to allow using the app, but the backend should work if configured properly (we used mockup information on the hackathon).

The app we developed is about buying beer. We like beer.

Uses an early version on Paperkit Material Design Framework, made by Dani Guardiola (me). Dogfood FTW.

Demo: coming soon
